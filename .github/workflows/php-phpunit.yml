# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: PHPUnit

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the trunk branch
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ trunk ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "phpunit"
  phpunit:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # setup the composer cache (vendor) with github actions cache and the cache dir defined in the previous step
      - uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
